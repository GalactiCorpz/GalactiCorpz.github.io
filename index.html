			Well, except for some pesky monkeys that keep throwing bananas at you.<br/>
			You swiftly decide to start gathering resources to build a raft and get the hell off this island."

			"Waking up after a ruthless battle at sea, you find yourself on the shores of an island. Probably part of the Lost Isles in the Mist.<br/><br/>
			You look around you and see no signs of friendly life as a pack of dire-wolves conquer this island as their own.<br/> You quickly rush to find resources to get off the island."
