			<post-title>Hnefatafl - The Viking Board Game</post-title>
			<post-date>2017-10-18</post-date>
			<post-message>
			As we say farewell to this month's 1-Week Game Dev challenge, we kick the rest of the month of with a simple game of Hnefatafl.<br/><br/>

			Hnefatafl became a popular game in the Viking era (around the end of the 8th Century to 1000 C.E.), while wars waged on.<br/>
			While there are many variations of his game, we will be using the most popular of them, Copenhagen Hnefatafl.<br/><br/>

			As a prototype, the game will be set on a small island, surrounded by Viking ships, you can play as either the Vikings or the Knights.
			It is set on a 11x11 board using strict rules according to the <a href="http://tafl.cyningstan.com/data-download/1012/copenhagen-hnefatafl-leaflet">Copenhagen(click here to view)</a> standards.<br/>

			At the moment, I have a working prototype going, but it is lacking a few of the rules still. I should have it up by end of Monday.

			Well, except for some pesky monkeys that keep throwing bananas at you.<br/>
			You swiftly decide to start gathering resources to build a raft and get the hell off this island."

			"Waking up after a ruthless battle at sea, you find yourself on the shores of an island. Probably part of the Lost Isles in the Mist.<br/><br/>
			You look around you and see no signs of friendly life as a pack of dire-wolves conquer this island as their own.<br/> You quickly rush to find resources to get off the island."
